    "The Employee dataset consists of 1,200 rows and 28 columns, which are categorized into quantitative and qualitative features. Among them, 19 features are quantitative—including 11 numerical and 8 ordinal variables—while 8 features are qualitative. The EmpNumber column, which contains unique alphanumeric values, was excluded from the analysis as it does not contribute to predicting performance ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain insights from the data, correlation analysis was performed to identify relationships between various features and the target variable, Performance Rating. Correlation helps measure the linear relationship between two variables, which aids in feature selection. The project followed a structured approach, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, along with department-wise analysis to achieve the project goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset contains both categorical and numerical data, and the target variable is ordinal, this is a classification problem. Several machine learning models were implemented, including Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Artificial Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP). Among these, the Artificial Neural Network (MLP) achieved the highest accuracy of 97%, making it the most effective model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key objective of this project was to identify the most influential features affecting performance ratings. Feature importance was determined using machine learning-based feature selection techniques. In the preprocessing stage, manual and frequency encoding were applied to convert categorical data into numerical format, as most machine learning algorithms rely on numerical computations and cannot process string-based values directly."
