    "\n",
    "## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Drop Unique and Constant Features**\n",
    "- **Dropped `EmployeeNumber`**:  \n",
    "  - This is a unique identifier and does not contribute to predictions.  \n",
    "- **Dropped `YearsSinceLastPromotion`**:  \n",
    "  - This feature was removed because a new transformed feature was created using **Square Root Transformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Correlation**\n",
    "- Used a **heatmap** to check for highly correlated features.  \n",
    "- **No highly correlated features were found**, so no additional features were dropped.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **üìå Heatmap Explanation**\n",
    "- A **heatmap** is a graphical representation of data where different values are represented by varying colors.\n",
    "- It helps in identifying **feature relationships** and potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking for Duplicates**\n",
    "- **No duplicate records** were found in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n",
    "- **PCA was applied to reduce dimensionality**.  \n",
    "- **Original feature count:** 27 (after dropping unique and constant features).  \n",
    "- **PCA Results:**  \n",
    "  - **25 features were retained** as they had minimal variance loss.  \n",
    "  - **2 features were dropped** as they contributed very little to the overall variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **üìå What is PCA?**\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset.  \n",
    "- It **preserves the maximum amount of information** while making the data easier to interpret.  \n",
    "- Helps in **reducing overfitting** and **improving model performance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Saving Pre-Processed Data**\n",
    "- After applying **feature selection**, the processed dataset was saved in a new file.  \n",
    "- The **target feature** (`Attrition`) was added back to the final dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### ‚úÖ **Summary**\n",
    "‚úî **Dropped unnecessary unique and constant features**.  \n",
    "‚úî **Checked correlation using a heatmap** and found **no high correlations**.  \n",
    "‚úî **Confirmed no duplicate records** in the dataset.  \n",
    "‚úî **Applied PCA** to reduce dimensions while retaining **important features**.  \n",
    "‚úî **Saved the final pre-processed dataset** for model training.  \n",
